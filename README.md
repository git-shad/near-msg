😄 Near Message is a program to communicate with your friend. I have a short story "I was an SHS student gamer in a computer shop and also we called 'com shop tambay' soddenly I want to talk with my friend secretly without knowing other." that's why I remember that time now I decide to build near-msg to free near chat to there friends.
